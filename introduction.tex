\section{Company Profile: HLS Asia}
HLS Asia Limited (HLSA), originally known as HLS India Limited, was established in 1987 as a public limited company in collaboration with Halliburton Energy Services Inc., USA. Created to provide world-class oilfield services in India, HLSA introduced advanced wireline logging and reservoir evaluation technologies to the country’s growing petroleum sector. Over the years, it expanded its operational capabilities, adopted international standards, and built a strong technical workforce. The company has consistently supported both national and global E\&P operators, earning a reputation for reliability, technological excellence, and professional service delivery across diverse terrains and challenging well environments.

\section{Aim and Scope of Visit}
The industrial visit to HLS Asia Limited was organized to offer students practical exposure to the tools and principles studied in the curriculum. In Semester 4, we learned the basics and applications of Well Logging, and in Semester 5, we focused on Production Logging. While lectures and laboratory sessions built our theoretical understanding, this field visit allowed us to witness how these logging tools are actually deployed in oilfield environments with accuracy, safety, and coordinated teamwork.

The primary aim of the visit was to observe real field equipment used for formation evaluation and production diagnostics. During the session, we were introduced to several important tools and technologies, including: Cement Log Tools, Resistivity Tools, Sonic Tools, Calliper Tools, Gamma Ray (GR) Tools, Neutron Tools, Perforation Guns, Shaped Explosive Charges and Data Acquisition Van.

Being able to see these tools, understand their working mechanisms, observe the operational workflow, and learn the associated safety practices gave us a level of insight far beyond classroom learning. The visit highlighted the meticulous planning, accuracy, and risk management necessary for successful subsurface operations.
